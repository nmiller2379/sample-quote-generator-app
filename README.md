# Sample Quote Generator

This is a simple quote generator that generates a random quote from a list of quotes. The quotes are stored in a `data` file and are imported into the `QuoteWrapper` component as a module. The program then selects a random quote from the list and displays it to the user.

Once the user has viewed the quote, they can click the "New Quote" button to generate a new random quote. Once they've generated a new quote, they can click the "Tweet Quote" button to tweet the quote to their Twitter account. (Although this isn't implemented yet.)

Thy can also click the "Previous quote" button to view the previous quote.

The program is built using React and styled with CSS. The quotes are stored in a separate file to keep the code clean and organized.

## Purpose

This project was created to practice using React and to learn how to import data from a separate file and practice with simple state management. It was also created to practice using CSS to style a React application.

It is a modified version of Free Code Camp's "Quote Generator" project and is a simple project for students in my React course to practice with.
